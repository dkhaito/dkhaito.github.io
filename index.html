<h2> About me </h2>
<p> I am a PhD candidate at  <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/" >Institute for Logic, Language and Computation</a> of the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
I am  mostly interested in modal logics for multi-agent systems, but I also take side-quests in the neighbouring fields of formal epistemology and deontic logic.
