<h2> About me </h2>
<p> I am a PhD candidate at  <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/" >Institute for Logic, Language and Computation</a> of the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
I am  mostly interested in modal logics for multi-agent systems, but I also take side-quests in the neighbouring fields of formal epistemology and deontic logic.
<br>
Before starting at Amsterdam, I completed my masters in philosophy at HSE University in Moscow, where I cut my teeth on formal methods in philosophy. At that time, I have also worked as a reserch assitant at  <a href="https://llfp.hse.ru/en/">International Laboratory for Logic, Linguistics and Formal Philosophy </a>. I was forced to leave Russia after a politically motivated arrest.
<br>
<p>
Outside of my academic life, I love to learn languages (you can communicate with me in English, Dutch, Belarusian, Russian and Ukrainian or try Georgian, Yiddish or Hebrew to have fun of my yet low proficiency in them). Once in a while, I collaborate with Amsterdam-based performance duo <a href="https://wolfenpaul.github.io/">Wolf en Paul</a>. You can also regularly find me at <a href="https://vegantaalcafe.nl/info/"> Vegan Taalcaf√©</a>. Before being forced to leave Belarus, I have volunteered for preserving the memorial in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurapaty">Kurapaty</a>. I have also done some volunteering for <a href="https://www.esjf-cemeteries.org/"> The European Jewish
    Cemeteries Initiative </a>".
